\noindent System on a Chip (SoC) is an embedded system module that has functionality in a silicon chip board that can also be called Veri Large Scale Integration (VLSI). The owner of the SoC design owns the copyright on the design of the system that has been created. Fabless manufacturing is a way of printing hardware modules that Integrated Circuit (IC) designers are Outsourching from outside the printing factory. Fabless manufacturing from IC design has gap design theft When the design will be printed or when the project requires mutiple module With various functions from various designers. Therefore every module is VLSI Of this chip designer requires proof of ownership of the designer or Production companies. In this study plans to make the verification of ownership design with 2 specific key verification that is Polygate as the main key that will activate the second key, and the second key will be active which process using digital filter algorithm.
